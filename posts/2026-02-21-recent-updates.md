I figured I’d try and write a different style of blog post this month. Instead of talking about tech, careers, work etc, I thought I’d talk about what I’ve been up to recently since I got back from my trip to the USA.

It’s crazy to think that we’re almost in March, and I’m ready for warmer weather to make its appearance as it has been raining non stop for weeks here in the UK.

Anyway, what have I been up to lately?

## Games

So Blizzard decided to release [Diablo II Resurrected](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536520/Diablo_II_Resurrected__Infernal_Edition/) on Steam and it was marked as being verified for the Steam Deck. I like Diablo, and I have a Steam Deck, so I thought why not?

Turns out Diablo II is still a great game, the resurrected version looks fantastic, and runs well on the Steam Deck. I’ve spent most evenings on the sofa playing this game. I’m glad that it shows what my current battery percentage is because my battery runs low when I play this game for a few hours and lose track of time.

I hope that Diablo III gets the same treatment, as I really enjoyed playing that when it came out over ten years ago. Plus, a remastered version of Diablo III could look really good.

Also watched the Xbox and PlayStation streams, and I’m really looking forward to Forza Horizon 6. It’s finally set in Japan and I can’t wait to jump back in when it comes out in May (which isn’t far away if you think about it). I first got into the series when the third one came out and I was *hooked* after I played the demo. The demo alone convinced me to get a whole new PC for it.

I have also been seeing a lot of interest around the [AYN Thor](https://www.ayntec.com/products/ayn-thor?variant=46692546642112), the dual screen Android device, which seems excellent for playing a wide variety of games. I may have to pick up a device like that in the future. Seems great for taking it on trips.

## Music

I’ve been listening to a surprising amount of new music lately, and enjoying music is something I discovered when I was in my mid-twenties. I currently use YouTube Music as my source for music. Here’s a quick overview of what I’ve been listening to lately:

### Wolf Alice

I stumbled across their latest album, *The Clearing*, a while back and I was instantly hooked. *Bloom Baby Bloom* might be my favourite track on that album and after listening to it, I looked at their other albums and *Visions Of A Life* is another phenomenal album. *Beautifully Unconventional* and *Don’t Delete The Kisses* are some of the best songs on that album. I would like to see this band live someday.

### Matilda Mann

I recently discovered Matilda Mann and her first album *Roxwell* is a pure joy to listen to. *Say It Back* and *Everything I’m Not* are my favourite tracks from the album, it’s definitely worth listening to. The new single, *Inventing,* is also excellent and worth giving it a shot. I also would like to see Matilda Mann perform live at some point.

### Helena Deland

This is someone I’ve started listening to recently, and I’ve been enjoying listening to *Altogether Unaccompanied, Goodnight Summerland* and *Jour 1596.*

### Blur

It feels like it’s been forever since Blur released an album, but I’ve been enjoying listening to *The Ballad of Darren.* It feels distinctly ‘blur’, which makes it a treat to listen to. My favourite song from it is ‘*Barbaric*’. Might have to pick this up in vinyl at some point.

### Other bands that are in my library

*The Amazons* released their latest album last year, *21st Century Fiction*, and it’s one of their strongest to date. The track, *My Blood*, is one of the highlights of the album.

I’ve been listening to *The Balance* by *Catfish and the Bottlemen* again as I hadn’t listened to it in a while and it caught my attention, it’s a good album with some great tracks like *Longshot*. 

## TV

A lot of my time watching TV tends to be putting something on YouTube to play in the background, but I do watch videos on my TV as well from time to time. I honestly watch a lot of YouTube on my desktop or my phone, and it’s probably my most used application. I did a post about who I [subscribe](https://www.joshblewitt.dev/posts/2024-09-01-youtube) to a few years ago, maybe I should revisit this as a video as I have several new channels that I subscribe to.

I’ve also been watching the new season of Fallout, which was pretty good, and I’d definitely watch another season.

Me and my wife have been obsessed with The Traitors, and it’s many different international versions. We’re currently waiting for the US version to be available on BBC iPlayer but we’ve enjoyed watching the New Zealand version recently. It’s fun to watch people’s theories and plans succeed or fail as the show progresses. I’m looking forward to seeing the South Korean version when it comes out (I think they’re making one?)

## YouTube

I [recently](https://www.joshblewitt.dev/posts/2026-01-27-ricoh-adventures-1) released another video about the photos I took on my trip to the USA. My editing skills are slowly improving and it’s a fun hobby to have. I might have to subscribe to services such as [Storyblocks](https://www.storyblocks.com/) so I can use better music, sound effects, and music. I would like to grow my channel first before I invest any money into the hobby.

I’ve got some video ideas in the works, and I’m currently thinking at the moment that I’m going to try and upload a video once every two months. I figure the more quality content I upload, the better understanding I’ll have of what works and what doesn’t.

## Programming

Programming has also been fun, and also *scary*. I recently signed up to a subscription for Claude Pro, primarily for access to [Claude Code.](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)

I recently put together a small project called ‘Ask Astronaut’, which essentially it allows a user to ask a question to Claude based upon on the random image from NASA’s API for the Astronomy picture of the day. There were some parts to this project that I wasn’t sure about on how to implement certain features, so I turned to Claude for assistance. And together, we got the project deployed.

I had another idea that I wanted to try and build, which involved sending a CSV to Claude for analysis, but this time I decided to write up a requirements document (which included information on what the tech stack should be, user stories, etc), and I handed it to Claude Code. The end result was that Claude Code developed the entire working solution in six minutes, which scared me.

Artificial Intelligence is making some terrifying progression, and it is making me think more about my career in the long term. I’ve been looking at how to create sub agents and I can see how several roles I had in the past could be eliminated due to this technology.

I’m planning on making a video about this because I have a lot of thoughts and I want to share my process on how I created the requirements document, and my updated views on artificial intelligence. I may even run Claude Code against the codebase for this blog and see if it can find any vulnerabilities or suggested improvements.

## Travel

Me and my wife have been thinking on where we would like to travel to this year, and we’re thinking of Paris, Bruges, and the USA (no surprises there). There are also a few spots in the UK that we want to go see, such as spending a bit more time in Manchester.

We enjoyed visiting Paris last year, but we barely scratched the surface of what the city had to offer, so we want to go back and try more restaurants, see more galleries and experience more of the city itself.

Bruges is on the list because it could be a potential weekend break. Bruges is a place that appears to be stuck in time and has a lot of charm. Plus, waffles, chocolate, and beer is hard to say no to.

Of course, the USA is on the list. Hopefully I’ll be able to explore more of [Huntsville](https://www.huntsville.org/) during my next trip out there. I also wouldn’t mind seeing a few other parts of Nashville.

## Photography

With the wet weather, and not having traveled anywhere, I haven’t been able to dedicate some time to photography. Once I visit a few places, I’ll have more to share. Hoping to go travelling again in April or possibly May.

## That’s all, folks

That’s what I’ve been up to recently, a mix of thinking hard about the future, learning new skills and enjoying myself. It’s tough out there right now, and I’m learning that taking time to focus on myself is important.
