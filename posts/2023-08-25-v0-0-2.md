Hello and welcome to the release notes of version 0.0.2 of Super Blog Starter!

This is a relatively small release but it has a brand new feature - **post tagging! 🏷️**

You can now set a series of tags (think of them as categories) in each of your posts, which are displayed at the end of the post.

These tags can be selected by your readers to find other posts with the same tag. 

For example, if there’s a post with the tag of ‘JavaScript’ and the user selects that tag, the user will be shown all posts with the tag of ‘JavaScript’.

To get started with post tagging, you’ll need to use the new markdown template with tags defined:

```markdown
---
title: "Introducing Super Blog Starter!"
date: "2023-08-20"
tags: ["Super Blog Starter"]
---
```

Super Blog Starter will then automatically include the tags at the end of each post, simple!

And if you don’t include a tag or don’t want to update every post with a tag, don’t worry. Super Blog Starter takes care of that scenario by providing a blank array for posts that don’t have any tags:

```jsx
// Ensure that the 'tags' field exists, or provide an empty array as a default value
const tags = matterResult.data.tags || [];
```

This website uses post tagging, so why not try it out here?
