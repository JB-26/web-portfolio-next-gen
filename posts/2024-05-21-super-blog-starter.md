Itâ€™s been sometime since I last talked about my small project, [Super Blog Starter](https://github.com/JB-26/super-blog-starter). In fact, I last talked about this project when I released v0.1.0. Although Iâ€™ve been busy, Iâ€™ve been able to maintain the project and make small improvements to it.

In case this is your first time hearing of Super Blog Starter, itâ€™s a starter template that allows anyone to have their own blog quickly and easily. Itâ€™s also what this website is based on!

Whatâ€™s included in Super Blog Starter? Wellâ€¦

- Homepage
- About page
- Blog page
    - Pagination included (and customisable)
    - Pinned Post feature
    - Links to blog posts
    - Ordered by newest post first
    - Tag your posts with a category that readers can find related posts
    - Search bar
- Blog posts
    - Signature at the bottom (that you can customise!)
    - Code formatting
    - Quote formatting
    - Embed iframes into posts
- Responsive design
- Header and Footer (that you can customise!)
- Customisable 404 page
    - Search bar
- RSS feed (that you can customise!)
- ESLint

So in this short post, I wanted to share whatâ€™s been going on with this, as Iâ€™ve just released v0.5.0 ðŸŽ‰

# The changes

- A small selection of automated tests using Playwright have been included. These will run automatically via GitHub actions.
- iframes can now be included in blog posts! Just add the iframe to the markdown post and youâ€™ll see it rendered on the page! However, these iframes wonâ€™t be rendered in the RSS feed.
- Updated documentation
- Package updates; NextJS is now running version 14.2.2. This includes several build and production improvements from build memory usage, to CSS optimisations. Itâ€™s worth an upgrade.

# Give it a spin!

If you havenâ€™t tried it yet, please do! Iâ€™m curious to hear what people think of it. It should be fairly easy to get going with the starter.

# The future

I intend to keep the project going, and I plan to make several new updates to it including adding more playwright tests and keeping the packages updated.

Until next time ðŸ‘‹
