description: Starting the new year with a video

Happy new year! To kick things off, here’s a new video about the photos I took on my recent trip to the USA, taken on my Ricoh GR III X HDF.

I was visiting the USA for three weeks over the holiday period, and it was an amazing trip. It was good to catch up with friends and family, see the sights, and have some good food (one day I will be able to conquer the Cheesecake Factory)

I can’t believe that the trip was over so soon, and now it’s back to reality. It takes me by surprise that three weeks can go by so quickly. Next time we visit, we’re going to spend some more time in Huntsville as the Space and Rocket Center was the highlight of the trip for me.

Anyway, the video!

This video was fun to put together, and I’m amazed that it was eleven minutes long. It took some time to edit and I’m making progress in understanding DaVinci Resolve more.

I’m slowly improving my video editing skills as well, one of my goals for this year is to have footage recorded in LOG so I can colour grade it (I might have to investigate in getting some LUTs). The DJI mic mini is sounding better as well, I ended up switching from stereo to mono and that resolved the issue that either the left or right side didn’t have any audio coming through.

I’ll have to make a post at some point explaining my recording and editing process, I’ve built quite the setup when it comes to creating these videos.

I think I need to work on how I present myself in front of the camera, at times it seems that I look and sound slightly robotic, and I need to relax a bit more and focus on being myself.

I’ve got plenty of video ideas to work on, and I hope to upload a new video in the next few months. Editing videos is slowly becoming a hobby that I am hugely enjoying, I think it’s because it allows me to be creative.

Now that I’m getting back into a normal routine, I’ll be catching up on some web development projects that I’ve been working on, which I’ll talk about more in the future.
