In my last post, I briefly mentioned about creating a newsletter that you can sign up to and receive an email when I post a new blog post.

And today, that feature is now [available](https://buttondown.email/JoshBl)! ðŸŽ‰

And itâ€™s **FREE**!

Powered through [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/), youâ€™ll find a text field and submit button for the newsletter at the top of the blog page, and at the bottom of each post.

This means that each of my markdown files can be read on:

- This website
- An [RSS](https://www.joshblewitt.dev/rss.xml) reader
- Email

So why should I subscribe?

- Get notified via Email when I create a new post, and read the post in your inbox
- Get access to content that isnâ€™t shared on LinkedIn or other social sites

Some might be wondering, why use Buttondown for this newsletter?

- Buttondown is GDPR compliant.
- Write in markdown
- Run by humans
- Free to use!

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Enter your email and press the subscribe button.
- Check your email for a confirmation email and press the link to confirm your subscription.
- A welcome email will be sent to you.
- Now youâ€™ll receive an email when I post an update!

So if you want to read my latest posts in your inbox, please subscribe to my newsletter (you can unsubscribe anytime)

I promise not to spam you too much.

If you have any questions, drop me a message!

Until next time ðŸ‘‹
