This blog (or any blog for that matter) could exist on services like Medium, but yet I chose the route of having my own website. I build, and maintain *everything* here.

Doesnâ€™t that mean more work for me where a large majority of my pull requests are just new posts? Using a service would make things much easier, right? Yes, but there is one main reason why; *control*.

I have control over the following:

- The domain address
- What framework I want to use
- The styling; from fonts, colours, to layouts
- The user journey
- How someone can interact with my website
- If I decide to change the way it looks, I can start from scratch!
- And so onâ€¦

[Ryan Barrett](https://snarfed.org/2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site) also thinks this and describes owning a website as a home, and I completely agree. Like a home, you can do whatever you want to it. Knock down walls, refurbish a room, get an extension, and thatâ€™s what owning a website is like. My website has made some very big changes over the years:

- At first, it used a CSS framework (*and we shall never speak of it again*). While the blog was a separate Jekyll application.
- Then I moved everything onto a single Gatsby application in 2020 (which was a much improved website)
- Then three years later, in 2023, I moved everything to NextJS (and it looks much cleaner)

I could post the exact same content on something like Medium or Tumblr, and leave the provider to handle package updates, redesigns etc. But I view those services like a hotel room.

Sure, the room is nice but youâ€™re very limited on what you can do. Plus, all the cool upgrades you want are behind the minibar. *And nobody pays for the minibar.*

But itâ€™s not just customising or choosing the tech stack when you own a website, you also control and own the data. 

All the posts on here canâ€™t be found anywhere else, and I can move the posts to any platform I wish. If I was on a platform ran by someone else, do I really own the data?

Letâ€™s go back to the house and hotel analogy; what if the hotel closes down and you lose everything? If you were in your home, you wouldnâ€™t have to worry about that as youâ€™re in control.

But what are the other reasons for me having my own website? Because itâ€™s a fun hobby. I enjoy writing blog posts about all sorts of things, and making changes to how it looks. I get to own a small piece of the internet and thatâ€™s cool.

This leads to my next reason, career. I work in software development. Itâ€™s important that I have something that I can show an employer that I understand the process of writing and understanding software. In the past, this website has come up in interviews, and it makes a great conversation starter. It sticks out and grabs attention.

Iâ€™ve been running this blog now for five years, and itâ€™s definitely something thatâ€™s helped me to relax after work, or work on over the weekend. Writing these posts has led me to discover software such as Notion.

## What next?

You might think there isnâ€™t that much to do for a blog. Sure, you could rewrite some text on the pages but this website is pretty much feature complete.

*Except for a few new ideas that I haveâ€¦*

One idea I have is using a service like [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) to create a newsletter. I have plans to create posts that are slightly more casual, which donâ€™t really deserve to be shared on LinkedIn. So the newsletter would be a great way to notify readers of new posts (it would be free to sign up to).

Then there is the fediverse. I wrote about this a few months back and I thought it would be great if this blog was on the fediverse. Then people could follow it on platforms like Mastodon or Bluesky. Which is cool!

## Should you own a website?

At first, youâ€™d think this might be very easy to answer. But actually, my answer depends on a few factors.

If youâ€¦

- Are comfortable with programming, and ready to get your hands dirty.
- Are willing to put the time in.
- Happy to own *everything* when it comes to running a website.

Then you should take a look into owning a website.

If not, then using a service like Medium will be great for you. Something like Medium gives you the tools that you need to start writing, which to some thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re looking for.

Regardless of what you pick, having a place where you can write and share your work with others is key.

Until next time ðŸ‘‹
