Itâ€™s been a while!

I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s October! Itâ€™s nearly the end of the year, where did the time go? I turn *31 years old* this month which is very scary to me. The fact that Iâ€™m getting closer to 40 is frightening. 

Iâ€™ve been super busy with starting a new job as an Application Analyst recently, and Iâ€™ve been planning a trip to the USA as Iâ€™m attending *two* weddings. Plus, Iâ€™ve been working on my house a little. So itâ€™s been a busy month or so.

So for this short post, I just wanted to highlight some of the improvements Iâ€™ve made to the blog and my small project, [Super Blog Starter](https://github.com/JB-26/super-blog-starter)

# The blog

So, whatâ€™s new on the blog? Package updates and performance improvements.

The packages that are used on this blog have been updated to the latest version. NextJS has been upgraded to [13.5](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-5). This version has the following improvements:

- 22% faster local server startup
- 29% faster HMR (Fast Refresh)
- 40% less memory usage
- Optimised Package Imports
- next/image Improvements
- And over 438 bugs patched!

Iâ€™ve also been doing some performance improvements on getting posts by a tag. Iâ€™ve noticed that in production, the function that gets the posts was *****very***** slow. So I decided to make some changes and it seems to be performing better!

For those who are curious, hereâ€™s the new function:

```jsx
export async function getPostsByTag(tag) {
    const allPostsData = getSortedPostsData();
    const postsWithTag = allPostsData.filter((post) => post.tags.includes(tag));

    const results = await Promise.all(postsWithTag.map(async (post) => {
        const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${post.id}.md`);
        const fileContents = await fsPromises.readFile(fullPath, 'utf8');
        const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

        const processedContent = remark().use(html).processSync(matterResult.content);
        const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

        return {
            id: post.id,
            contentHtml,
            ...matterResult.data,
        };
    }));

    return results;
}
```

The difference being is that this function is now an asynchronous function.

Iâ€™ve been seeing some performance improvements running locally, so hopefully this will improve the performance in production.

Iâ€™ve also fixed a weird Safari issue where the desktop view looked strange (why is it always Safari that has issues?)

There are a few other things Iâ€™d like to do with the blog as well, which Iâ€™ll work on over the next few months.

# Super Blog Starter

The current version of the project is **v0.0.3** and it features the improvements that Iâ€™ve been making to this website (except the improved performance of getting posts by a tag, thatâ€™s something I need to include in the next version).

The project is making steady (but slow) progress, so feel free to contribute and make suggestions!

I do have plans for this in the future, including adding some automated tests.

If you do use this starter, let me know! Iâ€™m curious to see who is using this.

# The rest of the year

As we approach the end of the year, the holiday season begins, Iâ€™ll be looking to relax a bit more. Iâ€™ll be spending some time writing up my â€˜end of the yearâ€™ wrap up post as well. I do have many other blog posts that are currently in progress as well, so I might find some time to finish one or two and publish them.

Iâ€™m hoping to get a [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/) for my birthday, so I might be writing up a few posts about that. I need to play more games as I need to find ways to relax. Plus, since Iâ€™ll be travelling a bit more, itâ€™ll be good to bring with me.

Until next time ðŸ‘‹
