Hello and welcome to version 4.1 of this website! ðŸ‘‹

Letâ€™s jump into this quick blog post with an overview of whatâ€™s new!

# A new font!

Yes, a new font is being used across the website.

Introducing [Reddit Sans](https://redditsans.s-ings.com/) - the font developed by Reddit!

# CSS clean up

There were several things that have been bothering me:

- Hovering over some icons would highlight them blue
- The photo on the main page was slightly squashed
- Hovering over the buttons would cause an underline on the text
- And other minor issues

These have been fixed

# Package updates

Several packages (including NextJS) have been updated to the latest version.

# Homepage improvements

There have been a few improvements to the homepage:

- More informed introduction paragraph
- Icons for my location, current role and workplace
- The email button has now been moved down, and centred on the screen.
- The photo is slightly bigger.

# Whatâ€™s next?

Coming up Iâ€™ve got some new posts that are *almost* done, and some that are in the early stages of writing.

Keep an eye out for them!
