description: "Featuring plenty of smaller channels"
---
Out of all of the video based applications out there, I keep coming back to YouTube. I’ve been watching videos on the platform for well over ten years now and it’s stood the test of time for me. I watch it on my desktop browser, on my phone, my tablet and even on my TV. It’s honestly getting hard to resist subscribing to premium. Especially with the adverts that appear when I’m watching YouTube on my TV and get interrupted by adverts every few minutes.

Sure, YouTube thumbnails are becoming increasingly more clickbait as time goes on (**“YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT”**), as content creators try to gain as many views and subscribers as possible. But I have recently found myself gravitating to content creators who create content who provide long form and engaging content with a focus on technology, software and UX.

There are a lot of content creators out there, so in this post, I want to highlight several channels that I believe offer high quality content. Some creators have a smaller following, others might have a larger following. Plus, I’m going to embed a video from their page here so you can get a feel of what sort of content they create! (If your viewing this post via an RSS reader, I’d suggest opening this post in a browser)

# **Christian Selig**

[Christian Selig](https://www.youtube.com/@cselig) is an iOS developer from Canada, famous for making the third party Reddit application, Apollo. Their channel is focused around technology, life and things they enjoy.

Christian’s recent video on a custom split keyboard is fascinating to watch. I’ve embedded that video below.

# **Phoebe Yu**

[Phoebe Yu](https://www.youtube.com/@phoebeyutbt) is a UX designer with a degree in cognitive science. Phoebe creates videos that are about how humans use psychology to design products and why today's tech design matters to you.

Phoebe’s videos are well researched and are fun to watch. If you have an interest in UX, you really should check out her videos. I’ve included one below about Japanese web design.

# **Eric Murphy**

The video I’ve included below is the video that got me to subscribe. It’s about why ThinkPads became the internet’s favourite laptop.

# **Becca Farsace**

If you love cameras, headphones, earbuds or anything that involves technology in the outdoors, you need to subscribe to [Becca Farsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace/videos). Becca previously worked for The Verge and is now, recently, an independent creator.

I’ve enjoyed Becca’s work when they were at The Verge. Becca’s videos are exceptional quality, knowledgeable and have an infectious personality. The video I’m including below is a video about the Pentax 17.

# Clint Basinger / LGR

[Clint Basinger](https://www.youtube.com/@LGR) makes videos about retro technology and has been making videos for over ten years. Clint’s videos are well presented, researched and are always an enjoyable watch. There is also the [LGR Birds](https://www.youtube.com/@LGRBirds) and [LGR Blerbs](https://www.youtube.com/@LGRBlerbs) channels that are more unscripted.

The video I’m including here is LGR’s dream Windows XP machine. It’s a fun watch to reflect back on old hardware.

# freeCodeCamp

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/videos) is a charity that allows anyone to learn to code for free. Their website is a fantastic place to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. The YouTube channel offers a wide range of free tutorials from how to use software to learning different programming languages. There are some fantastic videos on the channel and I can fully recommend it.

The video I’m including here is the most popular video on the channel, learn Python in 4 hours.

# **Michael MJD**

[Michael MJD](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelMJD/videos) creates videos that about vintage computers and old software. There are plenty of entertaining videos here. You could say it’s similar to LGR in some ways.

The video I’m including here is how you can order a Pizza from a Nintendo Wii (yes, even today you can order a Pizza from a Nintendo Wii!)

# Wrap up

I hope you subscribe (or at the very least watch some of their videos) to the channels I listed here. They’re all great creators.

I’m quite tempted to create some YouTube videos myself as a way of growing my audience. Plus, I’d see it as a way to improve my speaking skills. I’ll still keep writing as it’s a hobby that I enjoy but I think making videos would be another fun and interesting hobby to have.
