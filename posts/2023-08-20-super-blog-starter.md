When I launched [version 4](https://www.joshblewitt.dev/posts/2023-08-05-version-4) of this website, I said I would make a template available to use for those who want to make their own blog. Wether you want to make your own blog for professional use, or just simply want to own a small slice of the internet, I wanted to make something that anyone could use.

So today, Iâ€™m proud to share that the first version of â€˜Super Blog Starterâ€™ is now available to use! ðŸŽ‰

With this new starter, you can set up your own blog with minimal configuration. The starter is based on my own website, so youâ€™ll see some similarities. But, you can modify it and expand on it very easily.

So whatâ€™s included with Super Blog Starter?

Wellâ€¦

- Homepage
- About page
- Blog page
- Pagination included (and customisable)
- Pinned Post feature
- Links to blog posts
- Ordered by newest post first
- Blog posts
- Signature at the bottom of each post (that you can customise!)
- Code formatting
- Quote formatting
- Responsive design
- Header and Footer (that you can customise!)
- Customisable 404 page
- RSS feed (update the siteMetadata.js file with your changes)
- ESLint

And if you deploy to Vercel, you get to use Vercel analytics! (Which can be switched off if you don't want to use it)

All of this is included in Super Blog Starter and works **out of the box.**

These features are a core reason of why I decided to make Super Blog Starter; to make a great blog that stands out from the moment you start using it, that anyone can use, and a blog that you can modify and expand as you please.

To get started, check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/JB-26/super-blog-starter) and if you want to see a demo, click [here](https://super-blog-starter.vercel.app/).

Itâ€™s currently in a very early state, the current version is 0.0.1 so there *could* be some bugs (if you find a bug, make sure to raise it on GitHub). Iâ€™m planning on improving it, and adding new features in the future. If there is a feature youâ€™d like to see, get in touch.

Iâ€™ll be interested to see if anyone decides to use Super Blog Starter, and if you do, send a message and let me know what you think.
