description: Business as usual, once again.
---
It’s that time of year again, where I’m back doing my annual end of year review post, and welcome to the fifth edition. I enjoy writing these posts, it always gives me a good opportunity to reflect on what I’ve achieved. This is also the final blog post of the year.

I started writing this post in late September, as I wanted to get everything down that had happened this past year (funnily enough, I started to write last year’s post at roughly the same time). Also, I’m visiting family and friends in the USA for Christmas and New Year, so I wanted to make sure I got this post done before I fly over, I’ll be over there for roughly three weeks. Plus, I’ll be recording footage for my next video and taking more pictures on my Ricoh. Keep an eye out for that in the new year.

For those who missed the post I did [last year](https://www.joshblewitt.dev/posts/2024-12-22-end-of-year), 2024 was a rough year for me, and I wanted this year to be better. Thankfully, it has been a good year (to be fair, it wouldn’t have taken much for this year to be better than last year). 

If I were to pick a theme for this year, there’s one that comes to mind; *questions*. I had many questions that I asked myself and thought about this year. I might not have been able to answer all these questions, which is something I want to tackle next year.

Anyway, let’s start with the highs of the year.

## The highs of 2025

### Back to ‘Business as usual’

This seems weird to mention, but after last year, it’s good to have a sense of normality after what happened to me last year. I was able to enjoy the summer months this year, which was something I was unable to do last year.

It’s nice to be back in a routine where I don’t have to overly worry about life. I could relax more and focus on the things that I enjoy. Like travelling, writing, and photography.

It’s been a busy year for sure, but I’ve had time to take a step back, think and appreciate the down time that I’ve had.

### Traveled more

This year I visited some more places around the UK (like Bath), I traveled to the USA twice and went to France. It’s been a good (and somewhat expensive) year for travel.

Seeing Paris again after roughly 20 years was fun, I took some great photos and had a good time going around and seeing some fantastic art, architecture and culture. For my American travels, I got to see Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge for the first time, which was certainly an experience. For my upcoming trip this month, I’ll be looking forward to spending some time in Nashville.

Paris is a place where me and my wife want to go back to next year, and the next time I go, I’ll be better at speaking French and I’ll buy a croissant from a bakery in the early hours of the morning. I’ve already created a list of places that I want to go visit which continues to grow as I learn about places from various sources. From independent restaurants, landmarks and points of interest, there’s so much that we want to see and do.

We also want to visit Belgium, specifically Bruges (not only is it picturesque, it also has fantastic beer and waffles), so we’ll need to work that trip in sometime next year.

### A new phone

After using an iPhone XS for *six years*, I upgraded to an iPhone 16 Pro in March. It was a huge upgrade for me and I don’t regret it. A much better camera, SOC and most importantly for me, battery life. Taking it around the world with me has demonstrated that this phone can last for more than a few hours compared to my old iPhone XS. No more will I have to worry about tracking my flight on my phone and manage the battery at the same. It just goes to show how important battery life really is.

I feel that six years is a good length of time when it comes to a phone now, as yearly phone releases aren’t what they used to be. The upgrades now are somewhat minimal when compared to the previous release.

I was *somewhat* tempted to buy an Android phone, but in the end I stuck with an iPhone. Maybe one day I’ll go back to Android.

### Photography

I’ve been getting more into Photography this year, and have been thoroughly enjoying my [Ricoh GR III X HDF](https://www.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/english/products/gr-3/). I’ve been slowly improving my ‘photographers eye’, and I definitely enjoy and look forward to using my camera whenever I go traveling. I’ve even started to take it with me when I go to work, as I want to take some pictures before work and during my lunch break.

I’ve been slowly learning more about the community recipes for my Ricoh and I definitely want to improve my street photography game next year.

I even made a YouTube video about the camera, which goes to show how much I enjoy using it. Speaking of which…

### YouTube videos

This is something that I’ve been wanting to do for a while, and this year I’ve found the time to put a video together and publish it. It was about the [Ricoh GR III X HDF](https://www.joshblewitt.dev/posts/2025-11-23-youtube) that I bought.

I have plans to make more videos in the future, and it’s slowly becoming a new favourite hobby of mine. I’ve got a lot of video ideas noted down that I’ll slowly work through. One thing I’ve learnt is that modern phones are *really* capable at recording video in a high resolution. Recording audio on the other hand definitely requires an external microphone of some kind.

This blog isn’t going anywhere. I’ll post my videos here as well, which maybe will include an optional behind the scenes write up or some other insight. Think of it as an added extra for reading this blog.

### Worked on the home (slightly)

I was able to get the loft in the home boarded, which unlocked a huge amount of space to store things and it really helped in keeping the rooms look tidy. I worked with my Dad across several weeks on this and the end result was great.

I was also able to buy some more furniture, which definitely helped in making the house feel more like a home. Some of the new shelving units I bought for my home office definitely helped with that.

There are a few things that me and my wife want to do, such as get some tiling done in the kitchen and bathrooms, and buy some additional furniture such as a wardrobe (turns out wardrobes are super expensive). But that’s going to be something for next year.

### Getting back into programming

Towards the end of the year, I decided to take up programming again, and this time, I think it’s really stuck with me. I’ve made projects like the video game API, maintaining this website and the haiku checker. It’s fun to build stuff and see them live on the internet.

I’ve been working on TypeScript mostly, with trying to take my CSS skills a little further by learning how to use Tailwind in projects.

You can view what I’ve been doing on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JB-26) account. I’ll have to see if I can find time to work through some of the Advent of Code challenges this year.

### Version 5 of this website

I gave my website an update, where I removed a few pages, added a few new ones, and gave it an improved purpose. I also adopted the CSS framework Tailwind as I wanted to learn more about it. It was a fun side project and the website now feels more refined and focused on what I want it to achieve.

### Worked on some courses

This past year I’ve been brushing up on my programming skills (mostly in JavaScript/TypeScript) and been doing some courses. This year I’ve completed:

- Digital Product Management: Modern Fundamentals (Coursera/University of Virginia)
- Introducing the principles of Assessment (Cambridge University Press & Assessment)
- AI Fluency: Framework & Foundations (Anthropic)

Spending time on educating yourself is something I strongly believe in. I don’t want to be in a position where I’m no longer relevant, so this year I decided to take the course about AI that was offered by Anthropic just so I could understand the fundamentals about AI as this technology is evolving quickly.

### Took steps in taking care of myself

I’ve been making steps in getting my health back on track. Getting registered with a GP is easy (seeing a GP however is *not* easy), but finding a dentist is very tricky. As you might know, healthcare in the UK is free. But finding a dentist that offers NHS care is very hard, many dentists have chosen to not offer it anymore and be strictly private. I’ve been searching for a dentist for a few years since buying my home, and there isn’t any that offer NHS coverage.

So, me and my wife had to use my insurance I get from my work and decided to go private. My dentist told me that there are only *four* dentists in the whole county that I live in that offer NHS coverage. So even if I didn’t have insurance, I’d have no choice but to go private.

I’ve also taken an eye sight test, as I wanted to get everything taken care of. I might be tempted to buy some new glasses next year, as I feel that I want to try a new design.

It’s hard trying to take care of yourself, but I’m happy I’m making some progress.

## The lows of 2025

### What’s next for me?

In some ways, I’ve been left feeling not knowing what to do next in life. What’s next for me? Where am I going? Am I making the right choices? These are some of the questions that I have been thinking about lately. Maybe this is what happens in your thirties.

There’s a part of me that’s scared as I don’t know the answers to these questions, but another part of me that views it as a challenge that I can work on and be able to answer those questions. And that challenge excites me somewhat.

I’ve been doing a few courses and self development over the past year, to prepare myself for the future. But I still think that in some ways, I don’t know what’s next for me. This is something that I want to tackle next year and answer these questions.

### Mental health still isn’t great

My mental health took a hit last year, after I lost my job and was unemployed for the summer. And this year, it’s recovered somewhat but it’s nowhere near where I’d like it to be. I think processing what happened is going to take a little longer than previously thought.

There have been a few times this year where my mental health has been extremely low, but I have been able to manage it better which is a plus.

### I still drive my old car

Yes, I *still* drive my Vauxhall Viva, and I was close to getting a new car this past year but the cost of it was too high. I was hoping to switch to an Electric Vehicle but I’m not sure this will happen as these vehicles are still expensive. There could be a possibility of using a hybrid vehicle but the main thing I’m looking for in my next car is space, I need something that is more practical than my current car.

### Waiting for surgery

Speaking of trying to take care of myself, back in June, I was referred to the hospital to have some minor surgery (nothing serious, thankfully) done on my eyelid. I have been waiting since June for this surgery and I haven’t heard anything since. It’s been a disappointing experience, just to be referred for surgery was a struggle itself. I honestly think I may *never* get this surgery on the NHS and I’ll end up having to get it done privately. My wife seems to think this as well.

We’ll see what happens next.

## The next year

### A new car

I say this *every* year, but I promise (at some point) I will get a new car. My car didn’t cost me as much as last year when I took it to be serviced but as it approaches being ten years old, I need to trade it in while it still holds some value.

Earlier this year, I did research possible cars to buy and even test drove one, which was the Kia EV3. It was my first experience driving an EV and that car was so much fun to drive. But sadly, it was a little out of my price range.

There has been some new Chinese cars that have launched here in the UK which are very affordable, and I definitely have my eye on them. Some of these vehicles aren’t electric, and it’s a possibility as EV’s are still slightly expensive, plus I need to buy a charger and have it installed in my house, which is an additional cost. I’ve been keeping an eye on the used EV market, and hope that a decently priced used Skoda Enyaq or VW ID7 will *magically* appear.

I’m very much hoping that next year, I will (finally) buy a new car, of some kind.

### Travel even more

The next year, as previously mentioned, me and my wife definitely want to travel to Paris and visit the USA as our top priority. And we also would like to visit Belgium, more specifically Bruges. We immensely enjoyed our trip to Paris this year and we want to work through the list of places we want to visit in the city on our next trip.

Travelling is something that we both very much enjoy, and it’s something that I started to enjoy when I travelled to Tokyo in 2018 (that’s another place I want to go back to). There are plenty of places in the world that we want to see.

Next year will be another busy and expensive year for travel.

### Work on my photography

Photography is a fun hobby to have, and it’s something I want to get better at. In the next year, I want to improve my skills and take more photos. Also, I want to share the photos I take. As I travel to different countries, I’ll definitely remember to take my camera with me.

Maybe I’ll even find a way to get certain photos printed or put together a small book of some kind.

### Actually work on the house

There are a few things that me and my wife want to do to the house we live in, mostly just getting the kitchen and bathrooms tiled. We wanted to get this done this year, but we didn’t find the time to get it done.

Next year, we want to work on the house some more. The garden is also another area that could do with some attention. I’m not the best gardener in the world, but I think I can plant something to make the garden look nice.

### More YouTube videos

I’ve made one video so far, now I need to make more. This is something I want to do where I make a video about travelling, something that I’ve been working on or anything else that’s on my mind. Not sure on how many videos I’ll make next year, but it’s something that I want to work on.

If the videos are successful, I’ll invest in some additional hardware and *maybe* some additional software like Final Cut Pro (and definitely not Adobe Premiere).

Who knows, maybe I’ll make it into the YouTube Partner Program?

### Answer my own questions and gain confidence

As I mentioned above, I asked myself some questions in regards to what is next for me, and next year, I want to answer that question. By answering that question, I want to increase my confidence in myself. I’ve struggled with my self confidence for decades, and although I made some progress since I started work eleven years ago, there is still much to be improved.

I’ll be learning new skills, pushing myself and celebrating the small victories I can get. Sometimes I need to remember to take my time with things.

## A much better year

This year has been hugely better than last year, and that’s something that I’m grateful for. I’m hoping next year will be a year where I’m able to grow myself, and get more out of life.

Life is hard to navigate, but with help and love from friends and family, you’ll find your compass that guides you.

Thanks again for reading my posts this year, see y’all in the new year.
