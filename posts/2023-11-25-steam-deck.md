I turned 31 recently (that’s terrifying in itself), and for my Birthday I got myself a Steam Deck. I’ve had my eye on one for ages and I finally decided to get one.

I’ve had it for about a month and for this blog post, I wanted to share my thoughts on the device.

In short, it’s a fantastic device. It’s something that’s made me get back into playing games again.

If you’re unfamiliar with the Steam Deck, it’s a handled PC that runs Linux (SteamOS that is based on Arch), which has an APU developed by AMD and has other features such as a gyroscope.

I recently went on a flight to Atlanta and the Steam Deck kept me entertained on the whole flight (thankfully I had a power socket on my seat). I would normally bring my Nintendo Switch, but this time I opted for my Steam Deck. The fact that I can bring a handheld PC on a flight is crazy to me.

Now, I don’t have the newly announced OLED model (terrible timing, but not worth the upgrade). I’ll be talking about the LCD model of the Deck.

I’ve been playing the following on my Steam Deck so far:

- Warhammer 40K: Boltgun
- Final Vendetta
- Aperture Desk Job
- Inscryption *(which is phenomenal)*
- RoboDunk *(an unappreciated gem)*
- Fate - Samurai Remnant
- Cult of the Lamb

There are plenty of games I need to play on my Steam Deck, I have a long list of games on my wish list and in my backlog.

# First impressions

My first impressions were how light the Deck is, the good build quality, and after playing Aperture Desk Job, how powerful the hardware is for the cost, the APU does a fantastic job. So a very positive first impression!

The trackpads are also great. They’re responsive and the haptic feedback is a nice touch as well, but I have found that sometimes when using the trackpads in desktop mode, it can be tricky to highlight multiple files or folders.

I also liked the fact that the Deck shipped with a hard case, which is great for travelling. Again, I took it with me on a flight and the case protected the Deck during takeoff and landing.

# Performance

I’ve been very happy with the performance of the Steam Deck. Games have been running very well, without any major slow downs.

Sure, you can hear the fan spin up when things become graphically intense, but that doesn’t distract you from playing games. I’ve found that playing 2D games (like Final Vendetta) didn’t cause the fan to spin up that much.

I can’t really comment on the battery life as I tend to play the Deck in bed or connected to a power supply.

# Software Compatibility

The Steam Deck runs on Linux, and a large majority of games on the Steam Library *******aren’t******* compatible with Linux. This is where Proton comes into play. Proton comprises of tools such as Wine, to make it easier for Linux users to simply press ‘Play’ on a game.

Now, not every game doesn’t work despite Proton, but developers do make an effort to update their games to make it compatible with the Steam Deck. Popular games such as Baldur’s Gate 3 is compatible with the Steam Deck, and several older games in my library such as Alan Wake are compatible with the Steam Deck. Proton is being worked on, so compatibility with games will only improve over time.

Plus, there is also the APU developed by AMD which is also receiving support. Valve have been providing support for the Steam Deck by bringing new features and improvements.

# EmuDeck

I’ve recently been playing around with [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/), a handy tool that sets up emulators, and adds your retro games as non-Steam games. And it’s pretty fantastic. Having your retro games added as non-Steam items, with their own cover art and banners is a nice touch.

And EmuDeck handles configuring aspect ratios, themes, shaders and more with ease.

I’ve played around with Dreamcast, PlayStation 1, Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn so far and the performance is pretty great. I need to spend more time with it and configuring it.

Importing games can be a bit weird if it has multiple discs. I’m still thinking of a good way to import my copy of Biohazard 2 as each campaign has it’s own disc, and EmuDeck thinks it’s the same game twice.

# Accessories

The Steam Deck is a PC. And that means you can plug in USB accessories via the USB-C port. The only experience I have had with accessories is transferring my retro games over via a CalDigit USB hub and it worked with the Steam Deck.

I need to get the Steam Deck Dock and see what the experience is like when the deck is connected to a monitor or a TV (as I have a feeling that me and my family will be playing more of Jackbox Party Pack over Christmas)

# Wrap up

I haven’t scratched the surface of what the Steam Deck can do. There are still plenty of games that I need to play on the Steam Deck (and the Autumn sale certainly is tempting me with some big discounts on games). I also need to check out the Heroic Games Launcher as well.

So would I recommend the Steam Deck? If you’re someone who is familiar with Steam or brand new then absolutely. Valve have been updating the Deck and it can recently support for HDR if supported by the external display for example.

I find that the Deck is probably the better buy for the price as well. Especially when compared to it’s competitors such as the ASUS ROG Ally and the newly released Lenovo Legion Go.

I’m looking forward to diving into the Steam Deck more over the Christmas break!
