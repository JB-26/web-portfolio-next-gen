A while back, I posted how I was finding a job after losing mine towards the end of April. And now after securing employment (ðŸŽ‰) I thought Iâ€™d share some statistics, my thoughts and advice about it.

In a nutshell, it was rough. My mental health took a hit, and my confidence was crushed. This happened repeatedly when applying for jobs, it was a horrible experience.

How many jobs did I apply to before I secured employment? I applied to **173 jobs** in total that took me **84 days**.

Hereâ€™s a diagram I created on [SankeyMATIC](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=PTAEGUEMFsAcBsCmoBSB7ARhRkBOBjAC1ABMBLSAc1xgC4AoRgQVgTP0gBcy0A7AZ1ABtAGwBGALqgASogBWifJ0Ql6LNh259BQgKxSx%2DTqACSvZbgBuZRAHd%2Ba1vHZceA4QA4PUgOKE0RiqOGq7awmIAnFLqzkH0hsZmFtZ2OpKgAEy8JKbmiFY29vFGucmFOgAsUrIKSnFZOUn5KfbhUgDyAGad%2BQ70XT24adH4%2BIiwyqr8ZABeyLagAOwADMv0oKDEIqv00HiUZLyg8KBiGeuguKfnG8ZiHhdYGWsYlKD4aPBoVwDE3f%2BdC6cGgCWB4RDmUAAOXovDQJHmoAeG2IukWF34YPwhzeul0j2%2BCKua1uhEQ0GQGAuHy%2Bvy89ORoDQWLInAAnqd6J0vgt8ABXKxcAXIZYAOnxG0OZNwrM6uDQ0FAnH2iE41M%2B31APwiOt1F2ZkGx7NAYoq%2BPgkDZaD5xkJ%2BVAkBtCtc%2BAucj5RjInStMoO7hhG3dnu9EJIggDl0Qll6iGokFgxAjXGVREOHzgSGURjQoF4OFwiCM9AtGEQ8EENM1P1WNZJmzICOhF0IZEohGcbeMYrxF06fE4nUNyH4kAEAFp%2BPkvRdnHnMYacSbRTdIxbuNHpnNrnW9pReF6ORFzZBS%2DBeDBkPHYPnBABNDGzZBidEbWyIVuEYwVHYlsuWSDwHyl6sDeoD3hsnR8vA8CwAW2LTHwYEXLAASsm4DoYGg0YXG%2BH5fj%2BJ5lih0xaEcjqcGgAGtkcYgYkQ5KXk6vZkEMxiln2BaPAWkAANYoYcX70P%2BgHIBxezGAA5AANKKEnIQWnRkAAHqAElyRs%2DB8t0ymqXJnBkhSaDdJOxiQKAIiPCa1JWRsORrBSyqgBS5huCOvA8YgbLiewSEbM4nrQBgAGjmMd5AA) to visualise this data:

As you can see, the job market is *grim*.

Some say that finding a job is a full time job, and I completely agree. Every week day I was researching, finding and applying to jobs.

Let me break down the key topics I want to discuss.

# Mental health

When youâ€™ve applied for over 170 jobs, itâ€™s exhausting. It definitely takes itâ€™s toll on you.

There were days where I felt confident, that this would be a short gap, and that my application would get me an interview. Then there were days when my confidence hit rock bottom, where I wondered if I would ever be employed again. Did I need to take additional courses and get a certification? Would I need to go back to University? What about my house? Would I need to sell it?

As time went on, I slowly began to have more bad days, than good days. Itâ€™s an awful experience. It got to a point where I created a spreadsheet of calculating how much money Iâ€™d get back if I had to sell my house.

Itâ€™s been a tough time, and Iâ€™m glad I can put this chapter behind me.

# Ghosting

This happens more often than you think (see the data above), and itâ€™s something that can be easily fixed.

Ghosting isnâ€™t just an issue that companies are guilty of, Iâ€™ve seen this behaviour as well with recruiters. Iâ€™ve had a few recruiters call me with a promise that theyâ€™d call back, and they never did.

If someone applies to a position you are advertising, view their application and send back a response. Even if itâ€™s an automated response, just something to acknowledge that my application was viewed but youâ€™ve decided to go with another applicant.

# Was my application even viewed?

Speaking of ghostingâ€¦

Iâ€™ve applied to a lot of jobs via LinkedIn, Reed and Indeed. Especially using their own â€˜easy applyâ€™ systems. This essentially allows you to apply to jobs using the profile you created on their website with one button press. Now I can save time by applying to companies by using one profile, genius!

One day, I got an email from LinkedIn that a company I applied to via â€˜easy applyâ€™ had viewed my application. At first I thought â€˜Great! Theyâ€™ll get back to me!â€™, but then I realised that only *one* company had opened an application I sent. I also saw that companies were reposting jobs that I had applied to.

I used a spreadsheet to track the jobs Iâ€™ve applied to, and I decided to check against the jobs I had marked as â€˜Ghostedâ€™. I soon noticed that for the jobs I had applied via job boards, all of them apart from a few, were ones I had marked as â€˜Ghostedâ€™.

I then realised that other applications I had sent via Reed and Indeed were also, more than likely, never opened.

I had wasted weeks of effort in applying to places that donâ€™t even check their inboxes on job boards.

Itâ€™s a huge problem and something that needs to be addressed. I get that there are applicant tracking systems with filters, but applicants shouldnâ€™t have to stuff keywords from the job advert onto their CV and cover letter to get past these systems.

# No feedback

Whenever I would tell my wife that I had been rejected for a role, the first question she would ask would be â€˜Did they say why?â€™, and I would respond with no.

Sure, in an ideal world, it would be great to get feedback. But where companies are having *hundreds* of applications, itâ€™s impossible to give detailed feedback to each person.

# â€˜Please create an accountâ€™.  Again, and again.

Why do I need to create an account to apply for a job? Especially if thereâ€™s a chance that Iâ€™ll never apply to that business in the future. This is the part of job hunting that got on my nerves the most.

This is a different story for platforms such as LinkedIn and Indeed where they allow you to apply for roles on their own platform using the profile you create, and thatâ€™s great. You can manage your CV/resume on the application, save jobs and send messages. These platforms excel at their purpose.

But for companies, having a portal where I need to create an account to apply for one job just doesnâ€™t make sense. Ideally, it should be as simple as filling out a form, attach a CV/Resume with a cover letter and hit send. Sure, thereâ€™s the argument that you could track the status of your application. But that could be done by providing a unique code, similar to how you track a package from FedEx.

I can count on one hand where I applied to jobs where I didnâ€™t need to create an account.

# Intense competition

Iâ€™d quite often see on job adverts on LinkedIn that I could compare myself to the one hundred plus candidates who are applying for that same job. The fact there are *one hundred plus* applicants is terrifying. How would I get noticed and get an interview? Itâ€™s a difficult question to answer.

I spoke to family members for advice, and [my brother](https://matt.blwt.io/) said that the market is the worst heâ€™s seen for four years.

I ended up subscribing to LinkedIn premium to see how many applicants there were, and mark job applications as a â€˜top jobâ€™ (so hopefully my application could be seen). Being able to see the real number of applicants was terrifying. Some jobs were having *thousands* of applications. How do I get noticed out of that many applicants?

And remember, I wasnâ€™t just seeing this against one job, I was seeing this against *every* job I was looking at.

The job market right now is awful.

# Expired job adverts

Iâ€™ve seen plenty of jobs that are advertised as available on LinkedIn etc but when you visit the company website, the job listing has been removed. Itâ€™s super frustrating as I wouldâ€™ve spent time preparing a cover letter for the role.

The worst example I saw was when I filled out the form on the companyâ€™s website for a role, pressed submit, and then was greeted with an error message that they were no longer accepting applications.

# A whole new resume

After a month of applying to jobs, I slowly realised that my resume just wasnâ€™t hitting the mark, and that I needed a whole new one. So my brother got in touch with a former colleague who gave me plenty of great feedback on how to write a resume. That new resume is now on the homepage (built in Notion!) and I found it got me more interviews that my previous resume.

The key differences between the two was that in my old resume I was stating facts of what I did rather than explain what I was hired to do. I also didnâ€™t bold certain keywords to grab the attention of the reader.

# Advice for job hunters

## Seek help

Seeking help is something I struggle with, itâ€™s my biggest flaw. But getting help definitely helped me in not only providing feedback on my CV, but also in managing my stress. If youâ€™re looking for work, donâ€™t do this alone.

I reworked my entire CV and cover letter approach and I donâ€™t think I wouldâ€™ve done this if I hadnâ€™t sought advice.

## Keep going

I know you may have heard of this before, but honestly, do keep trying.

I went beyond my comfort zone and was willing to move to Manchester for roles if I was offered employment.

## Apply direct where possible

After being ghosted on so many applications, I decided to apply directly to companies where possible. This means not using â€˜easy applyâ€™ buttons on places such as LinkedIn and Reed, as they just donâ€™t work. Applying directly was a better move as I ended up getting responses faster.

Sure, majority of the applications were rejections, but at least I got a response.

## Spend time learning new skills

Make use of your free time effectively! I spent some time doing courses from freeCodeCamp to brush up my knowledge on a few areas. I think it definitely helped in my job search.

I'm still doing some courses now even though I've found work again as I enjoy learning and I think it's important to develop new skills in a constantly changing world.

## Track applications in a spreadsheet

If youâ€™re applying for lots of jobs, itâ€™s better to put it in a spreadsheet. So I decided to build one, and it works quite well.

The spreadsheet can:

- Per rowâ€¦
    - The role name
    - The company
    - Salary
    - Location
    - Whether itâ€™s on site, hybrid or remote via a dropdown menu
    - The URL to where the job was found
    - The status via a dropdown menu
        - Applied
        - Rejected
        - Interview
        - Offer
        - Accepted
        - In progress
        - Not progressing
        - Ghosted
            - And the status will automatically update the following two columns
                - Date applied
                - Date rejected
    - Interview date
    - Interview time
    - Interview link (if itâ€™s a video call)
    - Notes
- And it performs the following calculationsâ€¦
    - Total jobs applied to
    - Total rejections (as a count and then a percentage)
    - Total ghosted (as a count and then a percentage)
    - Combined rejected and ghosted (as a count and then a percentage)
    - Total interviews (as a count and then a percentage)
    - Total days unemployed

Iâ€™m planning on making this publicly available to use, keep an eye out in the near future.

# Wrap up

Going through job loss is extremely tough. Itâ€™s a scenario I wouldnâ€™t wish on anyone.

I am very lucky and grateful to find employment again and am hoping this is the start of my career bounce back.

This post has taken me a long time to write, and I hope that it helps someone else who has found themselves in a similar position.

If you are, keep going. You got this.
